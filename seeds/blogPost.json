So I'm just going to continue typing things. Earlier, I had had miso with bok choy and kale. I have some leftover bok choy and kale, so the question is whether I just eat that later or if I try to make it into a bigger, more filling dish. I bet I've typed enough at this point. Thanks for attending my rant. :)",
