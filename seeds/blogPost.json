Since I made this app in April 2021, I've learned React. \n \n Revisiting this app after having learned React, I can see that Handlebars was likely an important precursor to frameworks like React, though I don't think I'm likely to use Handlebars again. I like the straightforward separation of concerns in React. For instance, it's nice to be able to write all of the component-relevant JavaScript and JSX in the same file with the CSS being in a separate file in the same folder. \n \n Nevertheless, my knowledge of React and Handlebars is limited, and there may be very good reasons to use Handlebars over React in some instances.",
